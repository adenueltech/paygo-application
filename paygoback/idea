 System / Back-End Interactions
Smart Contracts: Handle PAYG micro-billing per second/minute


API Sync: Session data updates user/vendor wallets
Key Concepts
PayGo UID


Generated when a user subscribes to a PayGo service.


Unique per user per vendor (optional: reusable across vendors).


Links user wallet → vendor usage → billing.


Vendor Integration via SDK


Vendor adds PayGo SDK to their website/app.


SDK exposes a “Pay with PayGo” button.


User enters or selects Pay with PayGo” button
User enters  UID in vendor site when starting the service.


Billing Flow


Vendor site sends UID + service ID + usage metrics (rate, duration, API call count, etc.) to PayGo backend.


PayGo backend matches UID to wallet, calculates cost, and deducts balance.


PayGo sends success/failure response to vendor site → unlocks service if payment succeeds.


Key Concepts
Live Stream Creator (Host)


Creates a live stream session on PayGo platform.


Defines rate (per minute or per session).


Stream is live only/


Live Stream Attendee (Viewer)


Subscribes to the live stream via PayGo wallet


Wallet is charged in real-time per minute/usage.


Access is controlled via UID + session ID.


Content Ephemeral


After this window, the video is deleted to ensure privacy.


PAYG Billing


Micro-billing is per minute or per action.


Deducted from wallet automatically via PayGo backend.


PayGo SDK — Overview
Purpose:
 Allow vendors to integrate PayGo payments without handling wallet balances or private data. Users pay per usage, and PayGo backend handles micro-billing securely.
Key Points:
Works for streaming, SaaS, APIs, or any PAYG service outside paygo


Uses user UID to link wallet → service usage


Handles real-time billing, confirmations, and alerts


Lightweight JS library for web/React/React Native
